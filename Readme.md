##Soundcloud Music App

###API data from Soundcloud was utilized to create our own music search app.

- `modules`: Separate JavaScript files were created to reflected the following roles.

  1. Obtaining API data using an AJAX request `$.ajax()`
  2. Identifying information applicable to the search page from the AJAX response
  3. Placing searched data onto a HTML template using template literals
